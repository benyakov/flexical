# Writing Documentation

## Organization

In the `help` directory are directories for categorizing help
documentation, and help files with descriptive names ending in `.txt`.

Between the descriptive name and the `.txt` suffix, the files should
have a 3-character tag composed of a period and a 2-letter language
abbreviation.  This allows for translated versions of the help documents
existing in the same structure.  The language abbreviation in use is
determined by the configuration setting "<{language}>".

The first part of the file name should be a short description of its
contents, suitable for a heading.  It may contain spaces.

The special name "Contents" is reserved for the table of contents, which
is always displayed at the root of the help system.  Translations should
use the same name, with a different 2-letter language suffix.

## Formatting

The help files are written using the style of PHP Markdown Extra.  That
allows them to be readable in their original formatting, and easy to
display in HTML.  If a file should be left unformatted, the first line
should be the words "Suppress Formatting".

Links to other help files should use urls like this:
`?n=subdirectory/FileName.en.txt`, or if there are no subdirectories,
and with spaces in the filename, `<?n=File Name.en.txt>`.  All urls are
relative to the `help` directory.

A help file can include language-specific text from the FlexiCal
application by using special markup like this: &lt;`{key}`&gt; where `key` is
a key to the `$lang` variable set from somewhere within the FlexiCal
`lang` directory.  This markup is also ignored when the help file begins
with the line "Suppress Formatting".
