# Users

Users in FlexiCal come in several flavors, depending upon what you'd
like someone to be able to do.  Here's a summary of the kinds available:

* Those who are not logged in at all (unauthenticated users, or guest
  users) can see ordinary events and adjust which ones are listed.

* Level 1 users can also see events that are marked "Hidden."

* Level 2 users can also create, modify, and delete events.

* Level 3 users can also create new users, change their accounts, or
  delete them.  This is the superuser.  As far as FlexiCal is concerned,
  he's at the top of the earthly chain of command, and just below God.


# Creating and Deleting Users

When you first install FlexiCal, it will set up an administrative-level
user (or superuser), with the authority to do anything on the calendar.
Whenever you have logged in as such a user, clicking the "Change
Password" button in the button block at the bottom of the page will show
a table of current users with links to perform administrative tasks.

If you really want to change your own password, just Edit your own user.
Otherwise, you can add a new user with the link at the top, edit any
existing user, or delete them.  Just remember that if you delete all the
users, you'll be in a bind, with no way to log in.  Just because it's
possible doesn't mean it's always a good idea.

When you add or edit a user, you'll see that the first and last name are
stored, together with the email address.  The name is used to show who
has edited various events recently.  The email address is used for...

# Resetting User Passwords

Of course, an administrator can reset passwords manually, but on the
login page, there's also a link for those who have forgotten their
password.  They can enter either their user name or their email
address, and the calendar will send them a link to reset their password
in a fairly secure way.
