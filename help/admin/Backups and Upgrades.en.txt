# Backups

The superuser (see the [Users section](?n=admin/Users.en.php)) is able to back
up all the contents of the calendar by using the "Backup" button in the
button blocks at the bottom of the page.  This process will dump the
MySQL database with a mysql utility and send it all to your web browser
with a suggested filename based upon the time and date that the backup
is made.  Just save the file and keep it in some secure location against
the time when you need to restore everything in the database.  You can
make backups as often as you like.  The file names should come out
unique, and descriptive of when the backup was made.

If you need to restore the database, click the "Restore" button below
the "Backup" button, then select the backup file you want to use and
click the "Send" button.  Everything else should be done automatically.

Keep in mind that *everything* will be restored from the time of the
backup.  That includes all users and passwords, and even the state of
the database relative to the version of FlexiCal you are using.  So it's
not generally a good idea to restore from backup files made *before* the
last time you upgraded the calendar.

Which brings us to...

# Upgrades

Hopefully nobody will be trying to upgrade from phpEventCalendar by
Isaac McGowan, since FlexiCal forked away from it so long ago.  Still,
it may be possible.  More likely, you are upgrading from a previous
version of FlexiCal.

To upgrade, follow these steps:

1. Back up your calendar.

2. Download the archive of the newest version and copy it over the
    installation directory, replacing the existing files.

3. Look in the `upgrades` directory for the appropriate scripts to
   update from your old version to the new version.  Then, run them in
   sequence from old to new to upgrade the database.  If your old
   installation is earlier than FlexiCal 1.5, then start with the
   `updatetables.php` script.  (It might possibly even work to upgrade
   from phpEventCalendar.)

   How do you run these scripts, you ask?  Use your web browser like so:
   `http://your.domain.name/calendarlocation/upgrade/updateW.X-Y.Z.php`.
   Run those in sequence, because the newer ones will depend upon the
   older ones.  They will update your database for the newer version of
   FlexiCal.

Some of this upgrade process can be done automatically, but until
there's a demand for it, I think we can manage it this way.  My time is
too precious a gift to be writing code that will not even save anyone the
same amount of time it took me to write it.  So if you'd like the
upgrades to be automatic, drop me a line.  (And yet here I am writing
documentation! Lord willing, this will help somebody.)
