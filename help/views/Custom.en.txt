# Adding Custom Views

You can add your own custom views to the provided Calendar View and
Event List View.  Here's what it takes:

1. Add a PHP file in the `templates` directory named appropriate for your
  view.  Remember this name.

2. Optionally, create a subdirectory there with the same name (minus
  the .php extension) and place as many files in there as you like.
  One called `load.php` is expected there, and will be sourced
  automatically.

3. On the calendar configuration screen, optionally add the name you
   used to the `$SiteTabs` array.  (You could also make it the
   `$DefaultAction`.) Putting it in `$SiteTabs` will make it appear in
   the site tabs across the top of the page.  This is desirable only if
   your custom view generates a web page.

Whether it appears in the site tabs or not, the name you chose can now
be used as the HTTP "GET' parameter `action`, like so:

> `http://your.domain.name/calendar/index.php?action=the-name-you-chose`

There are sample custom views already, which the author uses to help
generate LaTeX content.

Just remember that if you add a custom view, you have the responsibility
to make sure it works.  Don't ask me about debugging your PHP code or
SQL.  On the other hand, please use the existing views as an example.
