# Event View

Event View shows a selected event, along with other events that happen to
fall on the same day.  It will remember the selected event during the
session, but if no event has been specified in the session, it will show
a message asking you to select an event first.

Events related to others show a set of navigation links to jump
directly to the next or previous related event (as long as it exists).

When the user has sufficient permissions, there will be a set of links
to copy, edit, or delete the event.  The text of the event is displayed
under the title and date, with Markdown formatting displayed.

The user name of the last user to edit the event also shows up under the
event text, as well as the event's category.
