# Extra Views

Within the `templates` directory of FlexiCal, there are PHP files
responsible for generating the various calendar views.  Some of these
files correspond to actual views available on the calendar's site tabs.
Others are more specialized views that produce output useful in special
contexts.  For example, the files `latex-bulletin.php` and
`latex-table.php` produce a specially-formatted version of upcoming
events that I use in church bulletins and in church newsletters.
Another example is `this-week.php`, which produces an HTML table of
events in the coming week, that can be incorporated into another web
page.  I will likely produce additional views in the future.  By
following the model of these extra views, the FlexiCal installer can
make custom views or templates that would be useful wherever FlexiCal
may be used.

Further documentation and tips for creating these templates will go
here.
