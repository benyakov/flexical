# Translating

At the present time, translations are handled through a PHP array
`$lang`, which is set in files located in the `lang` subdirectory.  The
filenames incorporate the 2-letter (ISO 639-1) language code describing
the language in question.  If anyone wishes to translate FlexiCal for
use in another language, just create new files in the same place, using
the existing files as a model.  All you have to do is keep the same
array keys, providing translated values.  Be aware that some of the
values are subject to tight space restrictions in the calendar's
interface.

Help translations may be provided by simply creating new
language-specific help files alongside the existing ones.  Again, the
2-letter language code is part of the file name, and you can use the
existing help files as a guide.

If you have any questions, please contact me via the FlexiCal web page
at http://www.christfor.us.
