## *"I need to change the time on a bunch of events. Can that be done all at
once, without changing each one individually?"*

There are two ways to do this: By filtering the events, or by dealing with them
as a batch of related events.

Doing this with filtered events: You can filter the events using the filter
button at the bottom of the page. The filtered events will be limited to the
ones you see on the page. If you want that to be more than one month's events,
you should use the Event List view and set the Span to the length of time you
want to include. If you want to limit the filtered events to certain
categories, you can use the category chooser button at the bottom of the page.
Once the filter is set, you will also see extra buttons on the top of the Event
List view. The "Time" button allows you to change the time of all of the
events.

For related events: If you have related events, you can very easily adjust the
details of all the events by ticking the "Include Related" box when you're
editing one of the events.

You may wonder how to get a bunch of related events. When you copy an event,
you can make the copies related by ticking a box for that at the top of the
copy form. You can also make a bunch of filtered events related to each other
by using the "Relate" button at the top of the Event List view.
