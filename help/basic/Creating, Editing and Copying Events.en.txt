# The Event Form

The most generic (and least useful) way to create a new event is to
click the <{addanevent}> button link in the block of buttons at the
bottom of the calendar.  It will only be visible when a user with
sufficient privileges is logged in.  The resulting page contains a form
with all the information you may want to store in that event.  The same
form is used for editing events that already exist.  The form contains:

* The month, day, and year of the event's <{datetext}>.
* The <{title}> for the event.
* <{text}> that will show up on the event details page or in Event List
  View.  Note that this text can be formatted using the rules of PHP
  Markdown Extra.  See [the PHP Markdown web site][pmconcepts] for the
  simple rules you can use to format event text.
* The <{starttime}>, with separate places for hour and minute, as well as a
  drop-down for AM and PM.  There are Javascript-powered spinner arrows
  for these, so that you can increase or decrease the numbers in each
  entry space.  If you enter the time in 24-hour format, you can leave
  the AM/PM drop-down menu alone.
* The <{endtime}>, with the same spaces as for the Start Time.
* A checkbox for "<{all day}>" events, which don't have a time associated
  with them.
* A <{category}> drop-down (see below for the <{new-category}> entry in
  this menu.)
* A blank space for creating a new category.  In order to use this, the
  <{category}> drop-down menu should be set at <{new-category}>.

## Creating Events

In Calendar View, when a user with sufficient privileges is logged in,
new events can be created for a certain date by clicking the number of
that day on the calendar.  This conveniently puts the date in question
into the appropriate fields on the event form.  The rest is up to you.

In Event List View, there is no similar mechanism, because the dates
that appear depend upon the events already in the database.

## Copying Events

New events can also be created by copying existing events.  When you see
the copy icon (![Copy](../images/copy.png)), clicking it will allow you
to copy the associated event.  It shows you a page similar to the event
editing form, but with a different purpose.  The top of the page lists
some data from the event you wish to copy, and the bottom allows you to
specify what kind of copying you wish to do.

* The <{repeattype}> drop-down box allows you to select from a variety
  of ways your event might be copied, as follows:

  * *<{singlerepeat}>* will copy your event to exactly one date.
  * *<{dailyrepeat}>* will copy your event to another date, and every
    day in between.
  * *<{monthlydayrepeat}>* will copy your event to multiple months between
    the original event and the target date, creating the copies on the
    same day of the month as the original event.  For example, an
    original event on the fourth Tuesday will result in new events on
    the fourth Tuesday.  The new events will only be created between the
    date of the original event (exclusive) and the target date
    (inclusive).
  * *<{monthlydaterepeat}>* will copy your event to the same day of
    multiple months between the original event and the target date.  The
    new events will only be created between the date of the original
    event (exclusive) and the target date (inclusive).
  * *<{annualrepeat}>* will copy your event to the same month and day,
    each year between the original event's date (exclusive) and the
    target date (inclusive).

* The <{repeatskip}> field is only useful for the repeating types of
  event copying.  It allows you to specify a number of matching dates
  that will be skipped between new dates that will be created.  For
  example, using *<{dailyrepeat}>* would normally put new events every
  day between the original event and the target date, inclusive of the
  target date.  You can change that to every other day by setting
  <{repeatskip}> 1, because one day will be skipped between each new
  event.  For every third day, use 2, and so forth.  The same principle
  can be applied to the other repeat types.

* The heading <{repeatcutoff}> specifies the target date as described
  above.

* The <{make copies related}> checkbox, if checked, will cause all of
  the copies to be related to the original event.  If the original event
  is already related to others, then the new ones will also be related
  to the same group.  If not, then they will form a new related group of
  events.  See
  [the Related Events page](<?n=basic/Related Events.en.txt>)
  for more details about them.

## Editing Events

If you are logged in with sufficient privileges, you can edit an
existing event in Calendar View by clicking the event title to see the
Javascript menu of icons, and then clicking the Edit icon
(![Edit](../images/edit.png)).  (If Javascript is not enabled, you can
also edit the event by clicking the time on events that have a time.)

In Event List View, the edit icon will always be visible for users with
sufficient privileges.

The same event form used to create events is also used to edit them,
only now it will be filled with all the data for the event you're
editing.

## Editing Related Events

See [the Related Events page](<?n=basic/Related Events.en.txt>) for more
about special uses of the event form. You can

* Move an entire set of related events to a different set of dates on
  the calendar.
* Move that entire set of related events while leaving the original set
  in place, making a new copy of them.
* Change details of a group of related events.
* Limit the effect of your changes to events in the future of the one
  you are editing.
