# Related Events

Some events can be designated as related events, which allows them to be
manipulated as a group.  For related events, two extra icons will appear
with the other icons, when a user is logged in with sufficient
privileges.  They function as follows.

* ![Show All](../images/showall.png) The Show All icon immediately
  customizes ListView to display all of the events related to the event
  that was selected.  To return to the previous view, click the
  "Unfilter" button in the button group at the bottom of the page.

* ![Delete All](../images/multitrash.png) The Delete All icon works the
  same as the Delete icon, only it allows you to delete *all* records
  related to the one selected, including the selected record.  This is a
  powerful function, so use it with caution.

## Event Details Page

When viewing the details of an event that's related to others, a
line of navigation links will appear on the right side, allowing the
user to navigate instantly to the details of the next or previous
related event, if one exists.

## Making Related Copies

When copying an event, a checkbox in the copy form, when checked, will
designate all the copies made of the current event to be related to the
event being copied.  If the event being copied is already related to
other events, then all of the copies will become related to the existing
group of related events.  If not, then all the copies, together with the
original, will form a new group of related events.

## Editing Related Events Together

When editing an event that is related to others, an <{include related}>
checkbox will appear on the edit form. When it is checked, *all* related
events will be updated.

If a change is made to the date of the event being edited, the dates of
all related events will be adjusted the same number of days that the
date of the current event is being changed.  If there is <em>no</em>
change being made to the date, then the other information is saved to
all related events. But any time there is a change made to the date, the
dates are the only thing that will be changed. This means if you want to
move a series of related events to another day while also updating their
other information, you will have to do it in two edit steps.

If the <{include related}> checkbox is not checked, then changes are
only made to the current event, and its relation or relatedness to other
events will be unchanged.

If the <{future only}> checkbox is checked along with
<{include related}>, your changes will be applied only to
events subsequent in time to the one you are editing.

If the <{leave originals}> checkbox is checked when you are changing the
dates on a set of related events, then new copies are made of the
related set of events at the new place on the calendar.

By using these settings you can:

* Move an entire set of related events to a different set of dates on
  the calendar. (with <{include related}> by itself, changing the date)
* Move that entire set of related events while leaving the original set
  in place, making a new copy of them. (with <{include related}> and
  <{leave originals}>)
* Change details of a group of related events. (with <{include related},
  not changing the date)
* Limit the effect of your changes to events in the future of the one
  you are editing. (by adding <{future only}>)

### Cautions When Manipulating Related Events

There is no undo. You have been warned. If unsure, save backups of your
data.

You may not realize how extensive is the group of related events that
you want to manipulate. FlexiCal can show you, using the
![Show All](../images/showall.png) icon.

Finally, if you use <{leave originals}>, the newly-copied events will be
*added* to the existing group of related events. If you don't want to
leave them this way, you can regroup them as a new set of related events
by [using the filter](?n=filtering) feature.

## Forcing a Collection of Events to Be Related

In Event List View, when a filter has been set, there will be a button
at the top of the screen that will force all events shown to be related,
based upon the first event shown.  Note that you can also narrow the
listing of events by category and date range before forcing them to be
related.

## Removing an Event from a Related Group

If you no longer wish an event to be related to other events, you should
copy it to a new event on the same date, while leaving the <{make copies
related}> checkbox unchecked.  You may then delete the original, as you
wish.  Note that you can tell which one is related to others by the
icons that appear, as described above.
