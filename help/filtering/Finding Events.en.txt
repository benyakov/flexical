# Finding Events

There are three ways you can narrow the scope of events that will appear
in the calendar.

* If you wish to find events by *category*, then you should use the
  [Category features](?n=Categories.en.txt) of the calendar.
* If you wish to find events by *date*, then you should either navigate
  to the time span in question (using arrows or drop-down menus as in
  [Calendar View](<?n=views/Calendar View.en.txt>)), or specify the starting
  date and time span you're looking for via the controls in
  [Event List View](<?n=views/Event List View.en.txt>).
* If you wish to find events by the time of day when they begin or end,
  or by their title or description, then you can set a filter.  This
  help page describes how to do that.

Any of these three methods can be use simultaneously for maximum control
over which events appear in the calendar.

To begin filtering on the time, title, or description, click the
<{filter}> button in the button block below the calendar.  Once a filter
has been set, you can remove it in one click with the <{unfilter}>
button.  You can also remove it from the "<{filtertitle}>" form
described below.

The form used for configuring an event filter allows you to specify
a way to match the title, the description text, and/or the start and end
times.  If the title or description is left blank, or the time settings
are left as a hyphen (-) that field will not be used to filter events.

As with the Event Form, the times can be in 24-hour or 12-hour format.
The title and description, however, are special.  You can simply enter
an exact piece of the text you wish to find, and the filter will find
any events that happen to match it exactly.

You can also use [Regular Expressions](<?n=filtering/Regular Expressions.en.txt>), a
powerful way to match a wider variety of things.  For example, entering
a period (.) in the title will match any event that has anything in its
title.  That may not sound very useful, but it is, because it allows you
to manipulate all of those events together in one
[batch](<?n=filtering/Manipulating Events in Batches.en.txt>), even though you may not be
interested in filtering by title, description text, or time.
