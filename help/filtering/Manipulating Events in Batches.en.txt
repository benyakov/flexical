# Manipulating Events in Batches

Once a filter has been set (see
[Finding Events](<?n=filtering/Finding Events.en.txt>)), and if the
currently logged-in user has sufficient permissions,
[Event List View](<?n=views/Event List View.en.txt>) will show a series
of buttons across the top that perform batch operations on all of the
events displayed with the filter in place, and under the current category
and date settings.

* The first button, *<{deletestr}>*, will delete *all* of the events found
by the filter.  It will not delete their categories, even if the
categories end up with no events, but *it will delete all the events.*
Use it wisely.  When you click the button, a Javascript dialog will ask
for you to confirm the action.  If you confirm it, your filtered events
will disappear.  If nothing happens when you click the <{deletestr}>
button link, then you probably don't have Javascript enabled in your
browser.

* The *<{relatestr}>* button will force all of the filtered events to become
[related](<?n=basic/Related Events.en.txt>) to each other.  If any of
them were previously related to another set of events, that relation
will be replaced with this one.  Again, a Javascript dialog will confirm
the action, but if you proceed, there is no easy way to undo this
operation.

The remaining buttons allow you to set information for the entire
collection of filtered events that would otherwise have to be set
individually using the
[Event Form](<?n=basic/Creating, Editing and Copying Events.en.txt>).

* The *<{title}>* button will show a form that can set the title of all the
filtered events to whatever you would like.  Note that if the current
filter uses the title, and you change all of the titles so that they no
longer match the filter, all of the filtered events will seem to
disappear.  Just click the <{unfilter}> button below the calendar to see
everything again, or the <{filter}> button to reconfigure the filter.

* The *<{text}>* button does the same thing for the description text fields
of all the filtered events as the <{title}> button does for the title.
The same caveat applies, if the current filter is based upon the
description.

* The *<{time}>* button allows you to set the start *and* end times for all
of the filtered events.  You can use 12- or 24-hour time.

* The *<{category}>* button allows you to set the category for all of the
filtered events, or to put them into a new category that you can
specify, just like on the
[Event Form](<?n=basic/Creating, Editing and Copying Events.en.txt>).
